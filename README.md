# ROAD-ACCIDENT-TRENDS-IN-THE-UK-TECHNICAL-REPORT-FOR-2021-2022
This report presents an analysis of road traffic accident data for the years 2021 and 2022 to understand casualty patterns, accident severity, contributing environmental conditions, and location-based insights. The goal is to provide data-driven recommendations for traffic authorities to reduce accident occurrences and casualty rates.

# Objectives
My main objectives in this project are:
Understanding accident trends across the years.
Identify high-risk accident locations and their contributing factors.
Examining the impact of vehicle types, road surface conditions

# DATA SPLITTING AND PROCESSING
**Data collection process**
The data was collected in the U.K. from police reports, traffic monitoring systems and weather monitoring agencies and was uploaded on datagov.com where I downloaded it.
**Data cleaning**
The cleaning steps I used to improve the quality of the data include:
Removed duplicated entries and restructured some variables.
Standardized the column formats to ensure consistency and clarity for analysis.
Handled missing value in road conditions conditions and weather.

**Key trends observed**
A total of 417,883 road accidents were recorded between 2021–2022 in the U.K.
84.1% of these casualties were slightly serious and did not need a special form of intervention. 14.2% were serious cases and needed special intervention from the response teams while 1.71% reulted in death.
Accident rates in 2021 totaled to 222,146. In 2022, there was a reduced number of accidents compared to 2021 but later increased towards the end. The total accidents in 2022 was 195,737 which shows a significant reduction in accidents between the two years. 
67.0% of the accidents occurred on the dry road while 27.5% on the wet/damp road. The icy road experienced 3.9% of the accidents while the snow type recorded just 1.6% of accidents.
During the day, 304,963 accidents occured which is 77.7% of the total accidents. Only 87,534 (22.3%) occured during night hours.
61.2% of the total accidents occurred in the urban area compared to the rural area which experienced just 38.8% of the total accidents.
Most accidents occurred to car users (325,922), motorcycles had 33,672, followed by van users with 33,472 accidents. Bus users recorded lower with 12,798 accidents and taxi had the least in the top 5 with just 7,563 accidents.
Most accidents happened in locations within 20m of the junction with a total of 170,259. At T junctions, the second highest number of accidents occurred in this location with 127,432 total accidents.

**Data-driven Recommendations** 
More signs should be fixed within each strategic locations especially the T junction region, to reduce accidents.
The governing body should conduct thorough training for motorists before issuance of a driver’s license especially for car users.
Separate routes/lanes for big lorries and buses should be created to avoid congestion that can lead to accidents
The compulsion of safety driving practices like the use of seatbelts by car users, and helmet use by motorcyclists with stricter penalties for defaulters.
The creation of bumps on long road routes and 20 metres before every junction.
Deployment of traffic lights at Roundabouts and T junctions.
Installments of surveillance gadgets on highways and strategic points.
Adequate lighting in every area for vision at night.
Deployment of a minimum of two traffic control officers at almost every junctions.
More training should be implemented for car users to ensure only professionals are on the road as this will reduce avoidable incidents.
